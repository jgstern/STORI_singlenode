1. Started m3.medium EC2 instance running RHEL 6.5. This OS was the only one I could find with a proper Perl installation.

2. Installed perlbrew
	\curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
	echo "source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc" >> .bash_profile

3. Installed GNUscreen:
	sudo su
	yum install screen
	exit

4. Installed gcc
	sudo su
	yum install gcc
	exit

5. Installed Perl for ec2-user:
	screen
	perlbrew install perl-5.16.0

6. Installed cpanm for (I think) all perlbrew perls
	perlbrew install-cpanm

7. Installed cpan modules
	cpanm -i LWP::Simple
	etc
